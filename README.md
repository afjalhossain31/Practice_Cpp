# C++ Practice

### Basics:   
Data types, variables, operators, control structures (if-else, loops), and functions form the foundation of writing any C++ program.
### Pointers:  
Variables that store memory addresses, essential for dynamic memory management, efficient data manipulation, and working with hardware-level operations.
### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):   
Core principles including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction that enable modular, reusable, and maintainable code design.
### Function and Operator Overloading:  
Ability to define multiple functions or operators with the same name but different parameters to increase code readability and flexibility.
### Standard Template Library (STL):  
Predefined set of generic classes and functions including containers (vectors, lists, maps), iterators, and algorithms that simplify data handling and processing.
### Memory Management:  
Handling dynamic allocation (with new and delete), avoiding memory leaks, and managing resources efficiently.
### Exception Handling:   
Creating robust programs by managing runtime errors using try, catch, and throw mechanisms.
### Templates:   
Writing generic and reusable code that works with any data type through class and function templates.
### Concurrency and Multithreading:   
Running parallel threads to improve performance and responsiveness in applications.
